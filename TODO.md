  - Better representation of mu/sigma and overall ranking. Currently the ranking
    is hidden from the user, which creates distrust in the system despite being
    easier to visualize and understand.
  - Delete accidental reports within X minutes of reporting them. Allows users 
    to correct mistakes while mitigating cheating.
  - Display a list of recommended matches in the dashboard.
  - User profile pages. Similar to the dashboard, but for individual users.
  - Pagination for the recent matches lists.
  - Highlight victories over low/high ranking players.
